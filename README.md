# School Time Table Generator
The time table generator assumes that the only information it recieves the time each teacher must spend in a class per week,and it create one of the many possible viable configuration via genetic algorithm.

The unstable time table generator uses pointers to impliment assosiation relationships.The issue is that assosiation relationship exists b/w all teachers,classes and subjects and it exists b/w table and teachers.However since all of these objects have vectors(which are allocated on stack,and is shifted each time the vector exceds its capacity) as such,over the lifetime their positio in memory changes, which causes all pointer and references to become invalid.To avoid that,list iterator are used.The compiler apparently updates them for every shift it peforms.The only differenec b/w stable and unstable is that unstable one uses pointer. It works for the given input, but thats cause this test cases never causes the vectors to exceed their capacity after assosiation in implimented.If more functionality is added it will definetly fail, and might even fail for different test inputs. But it is extremely fast, even with a single thread.
